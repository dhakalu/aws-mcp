A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AWS SDK functionality through boto3, enabling AI assistants and chatbots to interact with AWS services seamlessly.

## Overview

This project implements the Model Context Protocol for AWS services, allowing AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and other compatible chatbots to perform AWS operations through a standardized interface. By bridging the gap between conversational AI and cloud infrastructure, users can manage their AWS resources using natural language commands.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol is a standard for connecting AI assistants with external systems and data sources. It provides a secure, structured way for AI models to access and interact with external services while maintaining proper authentication and authorization.

## Features

🚀 **Planned Features:**
- **EC2 Management**: Start, stop, and monitor EC2 instances
- **S3 Operations**: Upload, download, and manage S3 objects and buckets
- **Lambda Functions**: Deploy and invoke Lambda functions
- **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Query metrics and logs
- **IAM Management**: Manage users, roles, and policies
- **RDS Operations**: Database management and monitoring
- **CloudFormation**: Stack management and deployment
- **Security Groups**: Network security configuration
- **Route 53**: DNS management
- **Cost and Billing**: Usage monitoring and cost analysis

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dhakalu/aws-mcp.git
cd aws-mcp

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## Configuration

### AWS Credentials

Ensure your AWS credentials are configured using one of the following methods:

1. **AWS CLI Configuration**:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

3. **IAM Roles** (for EC2 instances)

### MCP Client Configuration

Add this server to your MCP-compatible client configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "aws-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/aws-mcp/main.py"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can interact with AWS services through natural language:

### EC2 Operations
- "List all my EC2 instances"
- "Start the instance named 'web-server'"
- "Show me the status of instance i-1234567890abcdef0"

### S3 Operations
- "Upload file.txt to my-bucket"
- "List all files in my-documents bucket"
- "Download report.pdf from analytics-bucket"

### Lambda Functions
- "Invoke the data-processor function with this payload"
- "Show me the logs for the last execution of my-lambda"

### CloudWatch
- "Show CPU utilization for my EC2 instances"
- "Get error logs from the last hour"

## Security Considerations

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure your AWS credentials have only the minimum required permissions
- **Credential Security**: Never commit AWS credentials to version control
- **Network Security**: Use VPC endpoints and security groups appropriately
- **Audit Logging**: Enable CloudTrail for comprehensive audit logging
- **Resource Limits**: Consider implementing resource usage limits to prevent accidental over-provisioning

### Running in Development

```bash
# Install in development mode
uv sync --extra dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=aws_mcp

# Run linting and formatting
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run black --check src/ tests/
uv run mypy src/

# Run the MCP server
uv run main.py
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation for new features
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Use type hints throughout the codebase

### Code Quality

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format imports and code
uv run isort src/ tests/
uv run black src/ tests/

# Lint code
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Run all quality checks
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ && \
uv run black --check src/ tests/ && \
uv run isort --check-only src/ tests/ && \
uv run mypy src/
```

All pull requests must pass the CI pipeline which includes:
- ✅ Code formatting (Black, isort)
- ✅ Linting (Ruff)
- ✅ Type checking (MyPy)
- ✅ Tests (pytest with coverage)
- ✅ Security scanning (safety, bandit)
- ✅ Package building and installation tests

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- boto3
- Valid AWS credentials
- MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, etc.)
